**Instructions**

1. First: **This part is worth 30% of your grade.** Do the **take home** exercises in the [DM2022-Lab2-master Repo](https://github.com/keziatamus/DM2022-Lab2-Master). You may need to copy some cells from the Lab notebook to this notebook.
2. Second: **This part is worth 30% of your grade.** Participate in the in-class [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dm2022-isa5810-lab2-homework) regarding Emotion Recognition on Twitter. The scoring will be given according to your place in the Private Leaderboard ranking:
    - **Bottom 40%**: Get 20% of the 30% available for this section.
    - **Top 41% - 100%**: Get (60-x)/6 + 20 points, where x is your ranking in the leaderboard (ie. If you rank 3rd your score will be (60-3)/6 + 20 = 29.5% out of 30%)
